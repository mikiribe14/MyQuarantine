# MyQuarantine

App developed for the IT-AND course in VIA University College.

The purpose of this app is to keep a journal in a quarantine.
You can enter notes daily (or whenever you want), explaining your day and recording voice notes.
Also, the app provides updated statistics about the coronavirus situation, the global situation and per country.
